==Removed Mods/Libraries==

Core
Planets
Micdoodle8
Minechem

==Configs==
Updated all configs via simple binary comparisons, applied updated lines to configs that needed them.
Changed Potion and Enchantment ID configs that were not being caught by forge,please note this may upset some servers but but damage should be negligable. Affected mods are, Sanguimancy, AuraCascade, and Brewcraft. (Thanks to EmberQuill
Disabled the Progress bar from Lite Loader, allowing new forge Progress bar to display what is going on.

==Misc.==
We are working on removing as many uneeded recipes from NEI as possible to reduce FPS drag and load. This means using INpure Core to our advantage to nullify excess displayed items (e.g. BCA Canisters) and finding mods that have a config option to disable items like filled tanks (e.g. Mekanisim/Openblocks Tanks). These put a fair bit (or massive, in some cases) amount of strain on your rendering hardware, so if there is anything you can think of we have missed we will add it to the list of items to nullify/config out. (Thanks to EmberQuill for pointing out the Mek tanks config twice to me.)
Removals - These mods were removed to help with the various issues we have been having:
Minechem - This was to facilitate more free IDs in an attempt to help us stop creeping on the 4095 max
Galacticraft - This mods use of fake players has been a known issue with many mods, along with the conflicting sub-biomes with The Erebus, we decided to remove it for overall stability.
Blue Power - We removed this as we decided we were being too selfish trying to throw this in to the pack when we already have Project: Red. I know some players/servers might have been happier with Blue Power, we would have been too. The problem is that we have other sub-packs that rely on Project: Red, it has been there since we started the Resonant Rise 3 project, and finally it has proven more reliable and complete even with it's known issue of problematic lava columns.
Eras: We are now going to slowly release the new Era system, info for it here. (no ETA for the other eras)
Version System Change: We are dropping the MAIN from the name of RR it had it's purpose in RR2, however now it is just extra keystrokes and does not serve a purpose. RR2 had MAIN, LITE, and YOGS to differentiate what version we were pushing to ATL, however since RR3 uses a more complex sub-pack system to put every thing in one place for various reasons, the MAIN tag on the version is just unneeded.
Forge: Updated to Forge 10.13.3.1395-1710ls
Eureka: Eureka has been going to the library folder, while this wasn't hurting anything it was still going to the incorrect location. I have fixed this so it now goes to the library folder. So please ensure that there is not a Eureka mod in your Library folder when you update/re-install to this update please, other wise you will crash with a duplicate mod issue.

-- Dev only --
Began work of new Lite and Mainline sub-sets, under <set-name> New.
Removed Lite loader Progress bar, has been replaced by new Forge 1389-1710ls-branch Progress screen. This has been applied to eternity.
