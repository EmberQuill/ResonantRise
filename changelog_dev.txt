==Removed Mods/Libraries==
Hopper Ducts - This mod is just bloat, we have many alterneatives that work just as well or better.
Fluxed Crystals - This has been temporarily been removed at the Mod Authors request. Developer has noticed and issue with the mod as a whole, and would like us to discontinue distributing all versions of the mod untill these issues are fixed.

==Configs==
Headcrumbs Entity ID set to 101 as to not overlap with pre-exsisting ID settings
Turned off Gany's End/Nether/Surface version checkers.

==Misc.==
Set The Erebus and Twilight Forest to be selected as either or to limit Block ID overages.
